% the acknowledgments section

I would like to thank Anna-Lena Lamprecht, my first supervisor, and Jonathan de Bruin, my daily supervisor, for working together on the SWORDS project and providing me with the opportunity to conduct this study based on this previous work. It has been an invaluable experience for me. Additionally, I want to thank Fernando Castor for offering his advice as a second supervisor, as well as the FAIR Data and Software track as they have been very supportive during my time as a research assistant in the track.
