	abstract = {Abstract Background FAIR (findability, accessibility, interoperability, and reusability) guiding principles seek the reuse of data and other digital research input, output, and objects (algorithms, tools, and workflows that led to that data) making them findable, accessible, interoperable, and reusable. GO FAIR - a bottom-up, stakeholder driven and self-governed initiative - defined a seven-step FAIRification process focusing on data, but also indicating the required work for metadata. This FAIRification process aims at addressing the translation of raw datasets into FAIR datasets in a general way, without considering specific requirements and challenges that may arise when dealing with some particular types of data. Objectives This scientific contribution addresses the architecture design of an open technological solution built upon the FAIRification process proposed by “GO FAIR” which addresses the identified gaps that such process has when dealing with health datasets. Methods A common FAIRification workflow was developed by applying restrictions on existing steps and introducing new steps for specific requirements of health data. These requirements have been elicited after analyzing the FAIRification workflow from different perspectives: technical barriers, ethical implications, and legal framework. This analysis identified gaps when applying the FAIRification process proposed by GO FAIR to health research data management in terms of data curation, validation, deidentification, versioning, and indexing. Results A technological architecture based on the use of Health Level Seven International (HL7) FHIR (fast health care interoperability resources) resources is proposed to support the revised FAIRification workflow. Discussion Research funding agencies all over the world increasingly demand the application of the FAIR guiding principles to health research output. Existing tools do not fully address the identified needs for health data management. Therefore, researchers may benefit in the coming years from a common framework that supports the proposed FAIRification workflow applied to health datasets. Conclusion Routine health care datasets or data resulting from health research can be FAIRified, shared and reused within the health research community following the proposed FAIRification workflow and implementing technical architecture.},

	abstract = {Abstract Transparent evaluations of FAIRness are increasingly required by a wide range of stakeholders, from scientists to publishers, funding agencies and policy makers. We propose a scalable, automatable framework to evaluate digital resources that encompasses measurable indicators, open source tools, and participation guidelines, which come together to accommodate domain relevant community-defined FAIR assessments. The components of the framework are: (1) Maturity Indicators – community-authored specifications that delimit a specific automatically-measurable FAIR behavior; (2) Compliance Tests – small Web apps that test digital resources against individual Maturity Indicators; and (3) the Evaluator, a Web application that registers, assembles, and applies community-relevant sets of Compliance Tests against a digital resource, and provides a detailed report about what a machine “sees” when it visits that resource. We discuss the technical and social considerations of FAIR assessments, and how this translates to our community-driven infrastructure. We then illustrate how the output of the Evaluator tool can serve as a roadmap to assist data stewards to incrementally and realistically improve the FAIRness of their resources.},

	abstract = {In computational science and in computer science, research software is a central asset for research. Computational science is the application of computer science and software engineering principles to solving scientific problems, whereas computer science is the study of computer hardware and software design. The Open Science agenda holds that science advances faster when we can build on existing results. Therefore, research software has to be reusable for advancing science. Thus, we need proper research software engineering for obtaining reusable and sustainable research software. This way, software engineering methods may improve research in other disciplines. However, research in software engineering and computer science itself will also benefit from reuse when research software is involved. For good scientific practice, the resulting research software should be open and adhere to the FAIR principles (findable, accessible, interoperable and repeatable) to allow repeatability, reproducibility, and reuse. Compared to research data, research software should be both archived for reproducibility and actively maintained for reusability. The FAIR data principles do not require openness, but research software should be open source software. Established open source software licenses provide sufficient licensing options, such that it should be the rare exception to keep research software closed. We review and analyze the current state in this area in order to give recommendations for making computer science research software FAIR and open. We observe that research software publishing practices in computer science and in computational science show significant differences.},

This is the first milestone of the FAIRsFAIR project focused specifically on software as a digital object. In this report we discuss the state-of-the-art of software in the scholarly ecosystem in general and in the FAIR literature in particular. We identify the challenges of different stakeholders when it comes to finding and reusing software. Furthermore, we present an analysis of nine resources that call for the recognition of software in academia and that present guidelines or recommendations to improve its status - either by becoming more FAIR or by improving the curation of software in general. With this analysis we demonstrate to what extent each of the FAIR principles is seen as relevant, achievable and measurable; and in what sense it benefits software artifacts.

	abstract = {Research software has become a central asset in academic research. It optimizes existing and enables new research methods, implements and embeds research knowledge, and constitutes an essential research product in itself. Research software must be sustainable in order to understand, replicate, reproduce, and build upon existing research or conduct new research effectively. In other words, software must be available, discoverable, usable, and adaptable to new needs, both now and in the future. Research software therefore requires an environment that supports sustainability. Hence, a change is needed in the way research software development and maintenance are currently motivated, incentivized, funded, structurally and infrastructurally supported, and legally treated. Failing to do so will threaten the quality and validity of research. In this paper, we identify challenges for research software sustainability in Germany and beyond, in terms of motivation, selection, research software engineering personnel, funding, infrastructure, and legal aspects. Besides researchers, we specifically address political and academic decision-makers to increase awareness of the importance and needs of sustainable research software practices. In particular, we recommend strategies and measures to create an environment for sustainable research software, with the ultimate goal to ensure that software-driven research is valid, reproducible and sustainable, and that software is recognized as a first class citizen in research. This paper is the outcome of two workshops run in Germany in 2019, at deRSE19 - the first International Conference of Research Software Engineers in Germany - and a dedicated DFG-supported follow-up workshop in Berlin.},

The FAIR for Research Software Working Group (FAIR4RS WG) aims to enable coordination of existing community-led discussions on how to define and apply FAIR principles to research software, and to achieve adoption of these principles. The FAIR4RS WG is jointly convened as an RDA Working Group, FORCE11 Working Group, and Research Software Alliance (ReSA) Taskforce, in recognition of the importance of this work to these communities. The FAIR4RS WG was launched July 2020 with initial activities in four sub-groups, and it was endorsed in September 2020 by the RDA after being previously approved by FORCE11 and ReSA. In November 2020, the FAIR4RS WG in collaboration with SORSE organized two sessions for different time zones (17 November 2020 07:00 – 10:00 UTC and 19 November 2020 16:00 –19:00 UTC). Here are the links to the workshop's videos: From November 17th: https://youtu.be/hP-pvHlSQI8 From November 19th: https://youtu.be/RzAg-1l2Fjc During the workshop, we had four presentations and activities: - a background presentation on software and where we are with FAIR and software - an interactive presentation of the FAIR principles applied to software (using Mentimeter) - the FAIR4RS WG presentation and progress updates on the four subgroups - a discussion about three topics (initially planned to be in three separate breakout rooms): Topic n°1: What does interoperability mean for software? Topic n°2: What does reusability mean for software? Topic n°3: How would you want to get credit for making your software FAIR?   This workshop report contains the complete outputs from the workshop including: - the general presentation - workshop notes from the main room for both sessions (in the same file) - Mentimeter presentation and poll results (two separate files for each session) - chat room transcriptions (two separate files for each session) - six discussion files by topic and session: S1\_BR1\_Interoperability for topic n°1 on November 17th S1\_BR2\_reuse for topic n°2 on November 17th S1\_BR3\_credit for topic n°3 on November 17th S2\_BR1\_Interoperability for topic n°1 on November 19th S2\_BR2\_reuse for topic n°2 on November 19th S2\_BR3\_credit for topic n°3 on November 19th   We would like to acknowledge all the participants in the SORSE2020 FAIR4RS workshop who contributed to the discussion and to the workshop outputs.},

Ranging from small analysis scripts to full fledged data processing pipelines, software needs to be FAIR to enable other researchers to reproduce our own experiments and reuse our software. However software and data are fundamentally different – software is executable in nature and may have intricate dependencies. FAIR principles apply differently to software than they do to data and we must be aware of these differences. Existing initiatives such as the RDA FAIR for Research Software (FAIR4RS) working group (https://www.rd-alliance.org/groups/fair-4-research-software-fair4rs-wg) and http://fair-software.eu/ are already focused on addressing these differences and raising awareness of the importance of FAIR for software.},

The webinar will be of interest to anyone using, creating, or studying software in a research context. Attendees should be familiar with the FAIR principles concept.   This webinar will start with an overview of the current activities related to software in the RDA community and in the scholarly ecosystem. An in-depth analysis of the recently published recommendations of the FAIR principles for Research Software made by the FAIR4RS WG will follow. We will also present challenges identified when creating the principles and the limitations of FAIR for Research Software. Finally, we will share our current activities and next steps, where we will invite webinar attendees to join the WG’s newly formed subgroups aimed at supporting adoption and governance.   Research software is a significant and vital component of research. It is integral to all stages of research and can play the role of a tool, a research result, or a research object. In RDA, software issues and challenges were formalized at a Birds of Feathers session at the 8th Plenary in 2017, resulting in the Software Source Code Interest Group (SSC IG).  In July 2020, a new FAIR For Research Software Working Group (FAIR4RS WG) was jointly convened as a Research Data Alliance (RDA) Working Group, a FORCE11 Working Group, and a Research Software Alliance (ReSA) Taskforce, in recognition of the importance of software as a scholarly output and the necessity to review and adapt the FAIR data guiding principles (Wilikinson et al.) to research software.},

Since software source code has been recently recognised as an important asset also in the field of scientific research, complementing publications and research data, it is essential to collect and preserve it. Software Heritage (SWH) is the universal source code archive, collecting, preserving and sharing the largest collection of source code. Software Heritage is now providing the infrastructure for depositing and referencing software source code, in collaboration with national and international open access portals. In parallel, the RDA \& ReSA and FORCE11 working group FAIR for Research Software has identified divergences between software and data and the crucial need to translate the FAIR data principles to be relevant for software artifacts. In September 2021 the working group published the first version of the FAIR for Research Software principles after a community review. Finally, the importance of archiving, referencing, describing and citing software is a common goal to have better recognition and interoperability of software in a FAIR ecosystem.},

These resources are available as the supplementary materials of the report (Martinez et al., 2022) and can be downloaded and cited from this landing page. The list is open for additions by the community via comments directly to this link. We particularly encourgae authors of new and exisiting resources to add as much detail as possible to describe their resource and its relevance to the FAIR4RS Principles. Each of the columns has a description and whether the information is optional or not. Whe plan to add tags to the added resources for each semester and when there is another set of 30 resources we can resealease a new version. This list reflects the wide spectrum of global contributions supporting the implementation of the FAIR Principles, particularly regarding research software. It is a snapshot of currently available resources, although we expect that new resources will become available in the future and that the contents of the current list will evolve. It is important to note that most of these resources precede the definition of the FAIR4RS Principles; however, these still support their implementation. The resources were manually collected, analyzed, and categorized according to their type: guidelines, tools, metadata schemas and registries/repositories. For each resource detail is also provided on which of the FAIR4RS Principles that the resource supports.   Data collection This subgroup initiated a crowdsourcing effort to identify relevant resources. All members had the opportunity to provide and describe existing FAIR research software guidelines and tools. During the first two months of the subgroup operation in 2021, subgroup participants (referred to as data providers) added resources to an online spreadsheet. Data providers were encouraged to list resources that they were aware of, authored, or were supported by their institutions. Subsequently, the subgroup organized virtual calls to discuss the resources, their descriptions and the categorization. Over the next two months each data provider added descriptions to resources they were familiar with. This meant that some resources gained descriptions from different data providers. Before the completion of the list, the subgroup leads checked the list and cleaned it (removing items that lacked information or providing complementary information). The resulting list is the first crowdsourced list of its type and it welcomes your contributions!},
